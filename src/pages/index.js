                Imagine you want to go eat with someone. You'd like to go somewhere you both like,
                but you're apprehensive about revealing your true preferences. The other person
                might agree prematurely to please you, or they could take issue with an unusual
                suggestion.
                <br />
                <br />
                MPC is like having a special kind of telepathy - it gives you the answer to a
                question over your combined inputs, without having to share those inputs with
                each other, or anyone else. The only thing that is revealed is the answer to your
                mutual question.
                <br />
                <br />
                It's not actually magic, but <b>M</b>ulti-<b>P</b>arty <b>C</b>omputation is
                a class of cryptographic protocols which achieve the same thing. Inputs are encoded
                as bits and questions are formalized as boolean circuits over those bits. MPC
                Framework provides tools to make this easy in TypeScript.
